//Given the array below, perform the following tasks

var states = ['alaska' , 'alabama', 'arkansas', 'missouri', 'texas', 'nevada', 'california'];

//Use filter to only select states that start with 'a'

//Using method chaining use map and reduce each state to 3 characters
//(ie 'nevada' would turn into 'nev')

//Using method chaining use reduce to add up the count of character form the remaining words

//Print the final result (which will be a number)
